User Permissions Tree
=========================

## Overview

Within a particular workspace that you have access to, choose a user and when you expand the tree, it will show you the level of permission that this particular user has.

If you select "Auto Expand" in the app options, the tree will automatically expand the whole tree adding colour bars as needed. This will allow you to easily scroll down through the tree looking for unexpected colours, e.g. incorrect Viewer, Editor or Project Admin rights.

Unselecting the auto-expand will allow you to drill down yourself.
